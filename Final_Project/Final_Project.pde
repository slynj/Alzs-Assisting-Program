 ---------------------------------------------
 I think this project deserves a 4+ because I meet all the level 3 and 4 critirias, and did extra work to improve my program.
 1. Documentation & Commits
   My code and functions are fully commented with proper header, and is formatted/indented correctly.
   I also avoided repeating code by creating functions with APIs or settings that I use a lot(ex. font() in graphicFunction) with parameters. 
   I at leasted commited 1 - 2 times a day making my total commits for this project being 50!
 2. User Interface
   I used quite a bit of time working on the UI of this project, to make it easier for anybody (especially seniors) to use.
   I tried to have features that normal websites would usally have (ex. login, butotn hover, menu bar) so it is familiar and intuitive for any users.
 3. My Goals & Levels
   I met up all my goals that I set up for level 4!
        - Playable Games Made
        - Excellent looking graphics (VISUALLY APPEALING)
        - Has a login page with error messages under certain circumstances
        - Includes a doctor version with graphs and analysis
        - All buttons functioning correctly with hover features (or mouse cursor change)
    Moreover, I made extra feautres for the "Doctor Page" which I did not plan to do on the planning stage.  
 
 Features Added:
1. Login Feature
    - login page with 2 sets of id/password that leads to the main page of alz's
    - those 2 different id/password leads the user to distinct pages: doctor and patient page
    - logout button that brings the user back to "login" state
    - if not correct id or password, it gives a message to try again
2. Hover
    - hover feature for all of the buttons to better the user interaction and also to make sure users know it is a button
3. State
    - use of state makes users be able to go back and forth with the menus
4. Assesment
    - self assessment quiz where users can ask them selfs questions and answer it.
    - the answer is recorded to assess the user's health and gives advices
5. Game
    - serious game that checks the user's cognitive ability which is an ability easy to lose if you are a potential or even already is Alzheimer's patient.
    - records users score and time it took to finish the game in a txt file
    - everytime user plays the game, the data appends to the file (even when the program is closed, the file is remained)
6. Resources
    - links to help activate patient's brain
    - online activites that are known to help Alzheimer's patients
7. Graphs
    - visual line graphs to show how the score and time is changing every trial
    - for doctors and medical workers: so they can easily catch and monitor patient's status
    - becuase it keeps on appending on 1 txt file, it is easy to compare current data with previous ones
    - fake datas put it to show how doctors would see it (the time increasing, and score decreasing)
    - to easily see the data appending, erase the score.txt file in data directory and run the program. It will create a new socre.txt file. Play games several
      times to have datas in the file
8. Average
    - gets the average of all datas collected until now
    - has a button beneath it to easily go to the graph
9. Contacts
    - links to reliable & known associations, groups website to know more about alzhemier's.
    - easily connected through buttons
    - if clicked, it opens the link on a tab
10. Help
    - explains what each things does (to help users)
